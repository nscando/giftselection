# Gift Selection Module for PrestaShop

## Description

The Gift Selection Module for PrestaShop allows store administrators to manage promotional gifts that customers can choose during checkout. The module lets administrators assign existing products in the store as gifts and define promotional rules, such as minimum cart total or specific products that trigger the promotion. When a customer selects a gift during checkout, the module automatically deducts the selected gift's stock.

## Features

- Manage promotional gifts directly from the PrestaShop Back Office.
- Assign existing products as promotional gifts.
- Define custom promotional rules (e.g., minimum cart total, specific products in the cart).
- Display available gifts in the shopping cart.
- Automatically deduct stock when a gift is selected.

## Installation

1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**
    - Clone the repository to your PrestaShop `modules/` directory:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/giftselection.git giftselection
      ```
    - Or download the ZIP file and extract it to the `modules/` directory in your PrestaShop installation.

2. **Install the Module:**
    - Log in to your PrestaShop Back Office.
    - Navigate to `Modules and Services`.
    - Search for `Gift Selection`.
